-- Selecting the data we are going to be using


Select Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population 
from CovidDeaths
order by 1,2


-- Looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths
--Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country 
Select Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (Total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
from CovidDeaths
Where location like '%states%' 
and continent is not null 
order by 1,2


-- Looking at the total cases vs the population 
-- Shows what percentagfe of population got covid 
Select Location, date, total_cases, population, (total_cases/population) * 100 as Total_population_infected
from CovidDeaths 
Where location like '%states%'
and continent is not null 
order by 1,2


--Looking at countries with the highest infection rate compared to population 
Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, MAX((Total_cases/population)) *100 as PerecentPopulationInfected
from CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by location, population
order by PerecentPopulationInfected desc


--Showing countires with highest death count per population 
Select Location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as Int)) as TotalDeathCount 
from CovidDeaths 
Where continent is not null 
Group by Location 
Order by TotalDeathCount desc


-- Showing the continents with the highest death counts
Select continent, MAX(cast(total_deaths as Int)) as TotalDeathCount 
from CovidDeaths 
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent 
Order by TotalDeathCount desc


-- Correct Total amount 
Select location, MAX(cast(total_deaths as Int)) as TotalDeathCount 
from CovidDeaths 
Where continent is null 
Group by location 
Order by TotalDeathCount desc


-- Global numbers 
Select date, SUM(new_cases) as Total_Cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as bigint)) as Total_Deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as bigint))/SUM(New_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
from CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
Group by date
order by 1,2


--Total Global Numbers, not grouped by Date 
Select SUM(new_cases) as Total_Cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as bigint)) as Total_Deaths, 
SUM(cast(new_deaths as bigint))/SUM(New_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
from CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null 
--Group by date
order by 1,2


-- Joining the two tables 
Select * 
from CovidDeaths as dea
Join CovidVaccinations as vac
	on dea.location = vac.location 
	and dea.date = vac.date


-- Looking at Total Population Vs Vaccinations 
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations 
, SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations as bigint)) OVER (Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location, dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
from CovidDeaths as dea
Join CovidVaccinations as vac
	on dea.location = vac.location 
	and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null 
	order by 2,3


-- Using a CTE 
 With PopvsVac (Continent, Location, Date, Population, new_vaccinations, RollingPeopleVaccinated)
 as 
 (
 Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations 
, SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations as bigint)) OVER (Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location, dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
from CovidDeaths as dea
Join CovidVaccinations as vac
	on dea.location = vac.location 
	and dea.date = vac.date
Where dea.continent is not null 
	--order by 2,3
)
Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population) * 100 AS RollingPeopleVaccinatedPercentage
From PopvsVac
